To generate SWIG based bindings for Marsyas in Lua, Python, and Ruby, pass --enable-bindings to configure.

For each language it finds the interpreter for, it will build the associated binding. It is currently not possible to easily disable the building of the bindings for a language you have the interpreter for, nor is it possible to select a different interpreter.

These bindings have been successfully built and tested on Linux. For other environments your mileage may vary.
