MEAWS 0.4:  Music Evaluation and Audition for Winds and Strings
----------

This is a project by Graham Percival and Mathieu Lagrange.  Not intended
for public consumption yet.  We're just storing it here because it's
convenient.


FILES:
start.cpp: int main()

mainwindow .h .cpp: the main QT interface.  A lot of stuff is still
    left over from the QT "mainwindow" tutorial example file.  I haven't
    finished cleaning it up; that'll take another day or two.

backend .h .cpp: the Marsyas backend audio stuff.
    We might want to split this up, see below.

pitchBackend .cpp: the beginnings of integrating the pitch detection
    into this project, but I stopped near the beginning.  I was originally
    going to have two distinct MarSystems (ie one for the metronome and
    one for the pitch), but then I decided they should be in the same
    MarSystem.  We should discuss this design.

images/ : icons for the QT app.
exercises/ : data for the different exercises for the students.

sd.wav: sound file for the metronome noises.
