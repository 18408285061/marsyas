MEAWS 0.4:  Music Evaluation and Audition for Winds and Strings
----------

This is a project by Graham Percival and Mathieu Lagrange.  Not intended
for public consumption yet.  We're just storing it here because it's
convenient.


DEFINITIONS:
tactus: the tempo you would conduct (or listen to a metronome).  Regardless
of the piece, this will generally be in the range of 30-180 BPM.

tatum: the smallest unit of time.  You could call this the least common
multiple of every note- (or rest-) length.  Watch out for triplet rhythms;
you cannot simply take the shortest duration in every case.


FILES:
start.cpp: int main()

mainwindow .h .cpp: the main QT interface.  A lot of stuff is still
    left over from the QT "mainwindow" tutorial example file.  I haven't
    finished cleaning it up; that'll take another day or two.

backend .h .cpp: the Marsyas backend audio stuff.
    We might want to split this up, see below.

metro .h .cpp: the metronome object.

user .h .cpp: the User object.  (records previous tests, user info, etc)

images/ : icons for the QT app.
music/ : data for the different music for the students.

sd.wav: sound file for the metronome noises.
