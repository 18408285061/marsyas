----------

This is a project by Graham Percival and Mathieu Lagrange.  Not intended
for public consumption yet.  We're just storing it here because it's
convenient.


FILES:
start.cpp: int main()

mainwindow .h .cpp: the main QT interface.  A lot of stuff is still
    left over from the QT "mainwindow" tutorial example file.  I haven't
    finished cleaning it up; that'll take another day or two.

backend .h .cpp: the Marsyas backend audio stuff.
    We might want to split this up, see below.

metro .h .cpp: the metronome object.

user .h .cpp: the User object.  (records previous tests, user info, etc)

images/ : icons for the QT app.
exercises/ : data for the different exercises for the students.
