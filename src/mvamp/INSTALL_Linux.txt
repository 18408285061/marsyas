For Linux OS:
(Tested in Linux Ubuntu 9.04-32bits with gcc 4.3 -> may work on others)

1. Marsyas Bextract Vamp Plugin Compilation:

   - $ ccmake WITH_VAMP ON:
		* VAMP_LIBRARY -> static version of libvamp-sdk, from the install path - /usr/local/lib/libvamp-sdk.a
		* VAMP_INCLUDE_DIR -> vamp sdk src main path: /xxx/vamp-plugin-sdk-2.1/
   - $ make (vamp plugin compiled as shared dynamic library: /build/lib/libmvamp.so)

(Alternatively simply download pre-compiled plugin for Linux i686 at http://marsyas.info/download/vamp_plugins)

2. Marsyas Vamp Plugin Integration in SonicVisualiser Transforms:

   - copy libmvamp.so (or pre-compiled mvamp.so) to one of the following paths:
	* /home/jlo/vamp
	* /home/jlo/.vamp
	* /usr/local/lib/vamp
	* /usr/lib/vamp

(mvamp-plugins.cat, in pre-compiled version or /src/mvamp/, is a txt file for organizing the plugin functions within SonicVisualiser Transforms - for such you may also copy it to the chosen path above, yet it seems to be unnecessary)

NOTE: Plugin still being tested under Windows and MacOSX.
