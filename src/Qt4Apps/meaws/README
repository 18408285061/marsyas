MEAWS 0.5:  Music Evaluation and Audition for Winds and Strings
----------

****** WARNING *********
This is the unstable development branch of meaws.  I'm currently
rewriting everything.  It is highly non-working.



WARNING!!!  this is currently **NOT** portable.  Data files are
installed to /tmp/meaws.  This directory probably does not exist on
a Windows machine.  See "dataDir" and "DATADIR" in mainwindow.cpp and
meaws.pro respectively.


This is a project by Graham Percival and Mathieu Lagrange.  Not intended
for public consumption yet.  We're just storing it here because it's
convenient.


DEFINITIONS:
tactus: the tempo you would conduct (or listen to a metronome).  Regardless
of the piece, this will generally be in the range of 30-180 BPM.

tatum: the smallest unit of time.  You could call this the least common
multiple of every note- (or rest-) length.  Watch out for triplet rhythms;
you cannot simply take the shortest duration in every case.


FILES:
start.cpp: int main()

mainwindow .h .cpp: the main QT interface.  A lot of stuff is still
    left over from the QT "mainwindow" tutorial example file.

backend .h .cpp: the Marsyas backend audio stuff.
    We might want to split this up, see below.

metro .h .cpp: the metronome object.

user .h .cpp: the User object.  (records previous tests, user info, etc)

exercise .h .cpp: these are somewhat confused right now.  :(
analyze .h .cpp: 

icons/ : icons for the QT app.
data/ : data to be installed
data/music/ : exercises for the students.
