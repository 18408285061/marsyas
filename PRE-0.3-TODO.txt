GENERAL
- Figure out CPACK for distribution packaging (maybe we really need
to start distributing binaries)

- Add all the apps and Qt4Apps after weeding out dead code


CMAKE BROKENNESS

- fix FindDirectX.cmake (if necessary) and update docs.

- fix FindMatlab

- Add the CMakeLists.txt files for the Ruby and possibly
Java, Lua bindings  (maybe post-0.3)

- fix the linking for the vamp plugins.  (sness is doing this)



DOCS / USABILITY
- write developer docs for extending CMake

- revamp user chapters 3-5.

- begin docs on interactive python use.


OTHER

// what does this mean?
- Test Qt4 with MSVC, mingw, cygwin

- modify addMarSystem, etc. scripts to work with CMake instead
of autotools/qmake.

- Test on as many different systems with as many different compile
configurations as we can to make sure everything works

- split the marsyas library into a set of smaller libraries
  (definitely post-0.3)


RENAMINGS
- notEmpty -> hasInput
- done -> !hasOutput
