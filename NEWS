Marsyas 0.2.12 "Mao" Release Notes
----------------------------------

@c  FIXME: how silly do we want to be?
We are happy to announce that the latest version of Marsyas has escaped
from our dungeons and is now free to terrorize the rest of the world.
This release will truly shock and awe even the most hardened audio
researchers: Marsyas is Actually Organized!

This release introduces a divide between Users and (marsyas) Developers:
it is becoming possible to use the library without being a full-fledged
Marsyas developer.

- Documentation: huge improvements to the manuals and especially the new
  MarSystem reference.  Core MarSystems may be used without reading
  their source code to figure out how to use them.  In addition, the
  latest  version of the documentation is available over the web, at
      http://marsyas.sourceforge.net

- Stability: we are now performing automatic regression testing.
  Features which are currently working are much more likely to work in
  future versions.

- Libmarsyasqt: the old MarSystemQtWrapper is now included in a
  dedicated MarsyasQt library.  You no longer need to include files in
  the Qt4Apps directory in your personal projects.

- Directory tree organization: the source tree has been reorganized in a
  more logical fashion.


For more information about these features, please see the documentation.


Enjoy!
- the Marsyas Development Team
