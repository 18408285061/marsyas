To catch up to the latest trunk version of Marsyas (post 0.2.9) with the new API (MarControlPtr mostly), the source has been rewritten and moved to src. The old folders (common/ruby/python) have been merged together into a single directory. Some features have been removed as they haven't been ported yet, and documentation is no longer up-to date. Will try to fix soon. README is mostly correct, but again needs to be updated.

After almost two months, I have gotten back to make a few small changes (mostly to compile against marsyas-0.2.8). See ChangeLog

Updated the readme to reflect the changes in package.

After extensive testing, the rant in the readme file about C++ has been proven not completely accurate, and so has been removed. Also the swig-bindings have been officially added to the Marsyas SVN repository on sourceforge. Added a few new methods to the common SWIG interface (linkControl), as well as the sequencing versions of updControl.

Added documentation for common/ and ruby/ files (python users will just have to look at the Ruby equivalents). Built 0.3.5 and fixed Ruby's installer to support --prefix.

I'm looking to submit the current version 0.3.3 for the marsyas project. Before this can be done, I have to put more content in the documentation than what was created by the command "touch" (AKA nada). Any older entries than this have actually been written after this one, but refer to stuff I did earlier.

When I submit this to the project I will bump up the version (probably to 0.3.5). Also a python bindings set based on the same SWIG code has been generated. It compiles, but there are no guarentees on how well it will actually run. Plus it misses some of the Ruby dynamicness.

Met with George (y'all know him right?), and showed him my "stuff". He told me that if I got together a complete package (working code + documentation) he would consider adding it to the main marsyas distribution for the release of marsyas-0.2.6.

I first gotta come up with a better build system than my hacked together makefiles though.

Decided to put my recently learned SWIG knowledge to good use. I am making a SWIG binding of marysas for Ruby. Maybe later I'll add support for other languages.
