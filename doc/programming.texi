@node Including libraries and linking
@subsection Including libraries and linking

@cindex Compiling
@cindex Linking
Unless you write your program inside the @file{marsyas/src} directory,
you need to include the Marsyas libraries in your project.


@unnumberedsubsubsec Linux and other *nixes

The easiest way to compile Marsyas projects is to use a makefile.  In your
working directory, create a file called @file{Makefile} which contains

@example
all:
	rm -f *.o
	g++ -Wall -O2 -I./ -I/usr/local/include/marsyas -c -o myfile.o myfile.cpp
	g++ -Lusr/local/lib -o myfile myfile.o -lmarsyas -lasound
@end example

@noindent
(place a tab in front of the three lower lines instead of spaces)

If you installed marsyas in a location other than @file{/usr/local/}, then
change the @code{-I} and @code{-L} directories accordingly.  For example,
if you installed marsyas in @file{$@{HOME@}/usr/}, then you would use
@code{-I$@{HOME@}/usr/include/marsyas} and @code{-L$@{HOME@}/usr/lib}.  Once
the @file{Makefile} is written, simply type @code{make} to compile
your file.




@unnumberedsubsubsec OSX

To compile Marsyas projects in OSX, use the same @file{Makefile} as is used
in other *nixes, but replace the final line with

@example
	g++ -Lusr/local/lib -o myfile myfile.o -lmarsyas -framework CoreAudio \
		-framework CoreMidi -framework CoreFoundation
@end example


@unnumberedsubsubsec Windows Visual Studio

Please see the documentation for your compiler / development environment.
@c alternately, Gustavo could write something here.  :)


@node Hello World (playing an audio file)
@subsection Hello World (playing an audio file)

@cindex Hello world
@cindex Playing an audio file

Instead of printing @qq{Hello World!}, we shall play a sound file.  This is
relatively straightforward: we create a @code{MarSystem} which is a
series of @code{SoundFileSource}, @code{Gain}, and @code{AudioSink}.  Once
the network is created and the controls are given, we call @code{tick()} to
make time pass until we have finished playing the file.

@examplefile{helloworld.cpp}


@node Reading and altering controls
@subsection Reading and altering controls

Here we have modified the example from the previous section: we have added
the ability to start at an arbitrary position (time) inside the audio file.
To calculate the starting position in the file, we must know the sample rate
and number of channels.  We get this information from the
@code{SoundFileSource} with @code{getctrl}.

@examplefile{controls.cpp}


@node Writing data to text files
@subsection Writing data to text files

Extract data from a network for further analysis (plotting,
other programs, etc) is fairly easy to do with @code{PlotSink}.

@examplefile{writefile.cpp}


@node Getting data from the network
@subsection Getting data from the network

Putting together a network of MarSystems is all well and good,
but you probably want to do something with that data.  In this
example we simply print it to the screen, but the important
thing to note is that we have the data at the level of C programming.

@examplefile{gettingdata.cpp}



@node Scheduler
@subsection Scheduler

To schedule events using the new scheduler code, see the
Marsyas Expression Syntax documentation at
@uref{http://www.cs.uvic.ca/~inb/work/expr.html}


@node Command-line options
@subsection Command-line options

Getting options from the command-line is fairly easy; Marsyas provides
a handy object which parses the command-line for you.

@examplefile{commandOptions.cpp}


@node Writing your own MarSystems
@section Writing your own MarSystems

It's relatively straightforward to extend Marsyas by writing your own
Marsystems. As mentioned before each MarSystems must basically support
the process method that handles the dataflow and the update method
that handles the control messages.  There are certain conventions that
need to be followed so typically it is a better idea to copy and
modify an existing Marsystem rather than writing one from scratch. The
simple canonical example of a MarSystem that is what I use as a
template when I write a new Marsystem is @file{Gain.h} and
@file{Gain.cpp}

The new MarSystem must be added to MarSystemManager.cpp and the build
process.  Again, the easiest way is to look for @code{Gain} and do the
same thing with your new MarSystem.  There are four files which require
attention:

@itemize
@item @file{marsyas/MarSystemManager.cpp}
@item @file{marsyas/marsyas.pro}
@item @file{marsyas/Makefile.am}
@item @file{lib/release/Makefile.am}
@end itemize

Once you have edited these files, recompile marsyas (with automake:
@code{automake}, @code{./configure}.  With qmake, just run
@code{qmake}), make, and then make install.

* Visualizing data with gnuplot::  
@end menu


@node Visualizing data with gnuplot
@subsection Visualizing data with gnuplot

Gnuplot is an open-source data plotting utility available on every
operating system that Marsyas supports.  More information (including
downloads and installation instructions) can be found on the
@uref{http://www.gnuplot.info/,Gnuplot website}.

Data in Marsyas can be plotted easily: simply write the realvec to
a text file and call gnuplot on the result.

@example
void someFunction() @{
  string filename = "dataToPlot.txt";
	realvec data;
	data.allocate(size);
// ... do whatever processing here...
  data.writeText( filename );
  data.~realvec();
@}
@end example

After compiling and running the program, the @code{dataToPlot.txt} file
may be plotted with gnuplot.

@example
gnuplot> plot "dataToPlot.txt"
@end example
