@node Contributing documentation
@section Contributing documentation

The documentation for Marsyas is still a work in progress; we can use
all the help we can get.  Don't
say @qq{oh, I don't know enough} or @qq{I'm not good at writing
English.}  The question is not @qq{could anybody create something better
than my suggestion?}  -- the question is @qq{is this better than
nothing?}  Remember the most important thing about documentation:

@quotation
Documentation is like sex: when it is good, it is very, very good; and
when it is bad, it is better than nothing.   (Dick Brandon)
@end quotation


@subsection Manual

If you can add something to the docs, please send an email to
@code{<marsyas-developers@@lists.sourceforge.net>}.  A formal patch for
the texidoc is not required; we can take care of the technical
details.  Here is an example of a perfect documentation suggestion:

@verbatim
To: marsyas-users@lists.sourceforge.net
From: helpful-user@example.net
Subject: doc addition

In 4.2.1 Implicit patching vs. explicit patching, please add
----
It could be helpful to think of this like blah blah blah.
----
to the second paragraph.
@end verbatim


@subsection Examples

Small, easy-to-understand examples are also great.  If you have some
source code that illustrates something, we can add it to
@file{examples/}.  We use these examples to generate the
@userref{Example programs}.  You don't have to write any English at all!


@node Contributing source documentation
@section Contributing source documentation

In your @code{.h} file, just after the @code{namespace Marsyas \n @{}
line, please include a short documentation snippet:

@example
namespace Marsyas
@{
/**
    \ingroup Processing
    \brief Multiply input realvec with gain

	Simple MarSystem example.  Just multiply the values of the input
realvec with gain and put them in the output vector.  This object can be
used as a prototype template for building more complicated MarSystems. 

    Controls:
    - \b mrs_real/gain [w] : adjust the gain multiplier.
*/

class Gain: public MarSystem
@{
@end example

@strong{Warning: } the old convention included a @code{\class Gain};
this was a mistake in our understanding of Doxygen.  Please @strong{do
not} include an explicit class name; just make sure that the doc snippet
occurs above the class.

The @code{[w]} indicates that the control should be written and not
(usefully) read.  Valid options are @code{[r]}, @code{[w]}, and
@code{[rw]}.

The @code{\ingroup GROUP} will generally be @code{Processing},
@code{Analysis}, or @code{Synthesis}.  For details about these
categories, see @userref{MarSystem reference}.  For a complete list
of all available groups, see the file @file{marsyas/groups.doxy}.

There is one special group: @code{Basic} Processing.  This is a subset
of the @code{Processing} group.  No MarSystem should only be in the
@code{Basic} group; it should be placed in both groups, with

@example
\ingroup Processing Basic
@end example

Code which is not a MarSystem should be placed in the @code{Notmar}
group.

A complete list of groups can be found in the @file{marsyas/groups.doxy}
file.  The main groups are @code{Composites}, @code{Basic}, @code{IO},
@code{Processing}, @code{Analysis}, and @code{Synthesis}.


@node Code style
@section Code style

@itemize
@item
We strongly encourage the use of underscores@code{_} after member
variables (@qq{member variables} are variables which can be used
throughout the class).  In other words, in your @file{.h} files use:

@example
class MyMar: public MarSystem
@{
private:
	mrs_real varname_;  // don't use a plain "varname"
	...
@}
@end example

@item
By convention, a program (not a MarSystem) should return
@code{exit(0)} upon successful completion.  If any problems arise, the
program should return a number greater than 0.

@item
Files should use unix line endings.

@item
We use the @code{ansi} style defined in
@uref{http://astyle.sourceforge.net/,Artistic Style}; our exact style
file is in @file{misc/astylerc}.  To use the file, call

@example
astyle --options=@emph{/path/to/marsyas_topdir}/misc/astylerc filename.cpp
@end example

@samp{filename.cpp} can include wildcards, ie @samp{*.h} and
@samp{*.cpp}.

This style changes the positions of braces @code{@{@}}, tab indentation,
and a few other whitespace issues.  These issues are somewhat personal
and we can almost guarantee that everybody will hate @emph{some} aspect
of the style, but having a uniform style makes it much easier to
understand (and fix bugs in!) unfamiliar code.  You do not need to
format your source code according to this file, but don't complain if
your file is modified accordingly.


@end itemize

Unfortunately due to historical reasons these last two points are not
consistant within the Marsyas source code.


@node Playing in the mudbox
@section Playing in the mudbox

The easiest way to add code to Marsyas is to add a test to
@file{apps/mudbox/mudbox.cpp}.  This file is a huge mess of short
examples, many out of date and no longer working, but it seems popular.

To add your own test, follow the general pattern of other tests.  You
will need to modify

@itemize
@item @code{void printHelp(string progName)} : display the argument
which calls your test.
@item @code{int main(int argc, const char **argv)} : call your
test function.  Yes, that's a 100-line collection of @code{else if}
statements.  (see @qq{huge mess}, above)
@item @code{void test_myTestName()} : your actual code.
@end itemize


@node Contributing applications
@section Contributing applications

The source code for applications is in the @file{apps/} directory.  The
easiest way to get started is probably to copy everything from an
existing directory, then modify the files accordingly.

You should update all these files:

@subsubheading Build system: autotools

@itemize
@item @file{apps/MYDIR/Makefile.am}
@item @file{apps/Makefile.am}
@item @file{bin/release/Makefile.am}
@end itemize

@subsubheading Build system: qmake

@itemize
@item @file{apps/MYDIR/MYNAME.pro}
@item @file{apps/apps.pro}
@end itemize

By convention, your program should return @code{exit(0)} upon successful
completion.  If any problems arise, the program should return a number
greater than 0.


@node Contributing system code
@section Contributing system code


@menu
* Adding/removing to/from the build system::  
* Contributing non-MarSystem system code::  
* Contributing MarSystems::     
@end menu



@node Adding/removing to/from the build system
@subsection Adding/removing to/from the build system

To add files to the Marsyas build system, use

@example
addMarsystem foo
addClass foo
@end example

To remove files from the build system, use

@example
removeMarsystem foo
removeClass foo
@end example

Not that removing files from the build system does not actually remove
the files themselves.


@node Contributing non-MarSystem system code
@subsection Contributing non-MarSystem system code

If you have created a useful library or set of functions which you want
to share with others, you may add it to the Marsyas source code.  The
new files should be placed in the @file{marsyas/} directory, and added
to the build process.

@subheading Automatically

There is a Python script which automates this process; please see
@ref{Adding/removing to/from the build system}.  If you are a masochist
and wish to do this manually, see below.

@subheading Manually

The easiest way is to look for any appearances of
@code{realvec} in the below files, and duplicate these entries using
your @file{myfile}.

You must add your file to @emph{both} build systems, even if you
personally only use one.

@subsubheading Build system: autotools

@itemize
@item @file{marsyas/Makefile.am}
@item @file{lib/release/Makefile.am}
@end itemize

Now execute @code{automake} and @code{./configure} before recompiling
with @code{make}.

@subsubheading Build system: qmake

@itemize
@item @file{marsyas/marsyas.pro}
@end itemize

Now execute @code{qmake} before recompiling with whichever compiler you
use.

@node Contributing MarSystems
@subsection Contributing MarSystems

If you have created a useful MarSystem which you want to share with
others, you may add it to the Marsyas source code.  @strong{THIS IS NOT
REQUIRED FOR BUILDING YOUR OWN APPLICATONS!!!}  See @userref{Compiling and
using a new MarSystem}.

@subheading Automatically

There is a Python script which automates this process; please see
@ref{Adding/removing to/from the build system}.  If you are a masochist
and wish to do this manually, see below.

@subheading Manually

The new MarSystem should be placed in the @file{marsyas/} directory, and
must be added to @file{MarSystemManager.cpp} and the build process.
The easiest way is to look for @code{Gain} and do the same thing
with your new MarSystem.

You must add your file to @emph{both} build systems, even if you
personally only use one.

@subsubheading MarSystemManager

@itemize
@item @file{marsyas/MarSystemManager.cpp}
@end itemize

@subsubheading Build system: autotools

@itemize
@item @file{marsyas/Makefile.am}
@item @file{lib/release/Makefile.am}
@end itemize

Now execute @code{automake} and @code{./configure} before recompiling
with @code{make}.

@subsubheading Build system: qmake

@itemize
@item @file{marsyas/marsyas.pro}
@end itemize

Now execute @code{qmake} before recompiling with whichever compiler you
use.


@node Sending a patch
@section Sending a patch

@subheading Checklist

@itemize
@item Does Marsyas still compile?
@item Do the @userref{Regression tests} still pass successfully?
@item Did you add @userref{Contributing source documentation} (if applicable)?
@item Did you add your file(s) to the @code{autotools} and @code{qmake}
build precess?
@end itemize

If the answer to all these questions is @emph{yes}, then proceed.


@subheading Producing the patch

To produce a patch with svn, simply type

@example
svn diff > mypatch.diff
@end example

@noindent
and then send the resulting file to
@code{<marsyas-developers@@lists.sourceforge.net>}.

If you have SVN write access, you may simply type

@example
svn ci
@end example


@node Building documentation
@section Building documentation

This manual is built with texinfo, and the source code documentation is
created with doxygen.  These software packages may be installed from
