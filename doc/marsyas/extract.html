extract is a single-file executable for feature extraction. 
It can be used as part of external systems for feature
extraction therefore it outputs the results in a simple
tab-separated text file. For more serious feature extraction
over multiple files check bextract which is what I use most
of the time. It also serves as an example of a network
of MarSystems with relatively complicated structure. 
The following commands extract a single vector of features
based on the first 30 seconds of the provided
soundfile. By default the feature extractor is based on
extracting features based on the magnitude of the Short Time
Fourier Transform (STFT) (i.e means and variances of Spectral
Centroid, Rolloff, Flux). The second command extracts
the means and variances of Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients.
