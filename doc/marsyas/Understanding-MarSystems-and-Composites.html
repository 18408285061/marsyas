<h2 class="chapter">4 Understanding MarSystems and Composites</h2>

<p>In order to fully take advantage of the capabilities of Marsyas it is
important to understand how it works internally. The architecture of
Marsyas reflects an underlying dataflow model that I find useful in
implementing real and non-real time audio analysis and synthesis
systems. In marsyas 0.2 a lot of things can be accomplished by
assembling complex networks of basic building blocks called MarSystems
that process data. This is the so called &ldquo;Black-Box&rdquo; functionality
of the framework. In addition the programmer can also write directly
her/his own building blocks directly in C++ following a certain API
and coding conventions offering the so called &ldquo;White-Box&rdquo;
functionality. The next two sections describe building networks and
writing new MarSystems respectively.
