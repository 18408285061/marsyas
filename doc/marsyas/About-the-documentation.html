<h3 class="section">1.3 About the documentation</h3>

<p>In addition to this manual, there are example files included in the
Marsyas source tree.  Many of these files are also included in the
manual, but you may prefer to examine these files in your favorite
text editor with your own syntax highlighting.

     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="file">examples/</span></samp>: the simplest examples are here.  These files
are provided only for learning; they have little purpose as actual programs. 
<li><samp><span class="file">qt4GUIs/tutorial</span></samp>: a simple QT4/Marsyas program.  Just like
the files in <samp><span class="file">examples/</span></samp>, it has little value as a standalone program. 
</ul>

   <p>Once you are familiar with everything covered in this manual and those
examples, you should examine the source code:

     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="file">src/</span></samp>: the source code for real Marsyas executables.  These
are real, working programs.  This means that they have poor comments,
bad variable names, and are difficult to read.  :)
<li><samp><span class="file">marsyas/</span></samp>: the source code for MarSystems.  These are the
basic building blocks of Marsyas, and are even more difficult to read. 
</ul>

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.1 Help!</h4>

<p>The documentation for Marsyas is still a work in progress; we can use
all the help we can get.  Don't
say &ldquo;oh, I don't know enough&rdquo; or &ldquo;I'm not good at writing English.&rdquo;  The
question is
not &ldquo;could anybody create something
better than my suggestion?&rdquo;  &ndash; the question is &ldquo;is this better than
nothing?&rdquo;  Remember the most important thing about documentation:

   <blockquote>
Documentation is like sex: when it is good, it is very, very good; and
when it is bad, it is better than nothing.   (Dick Brandon)
</blockquote>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Manual</h5>

<p>If you can add something to the docs, please send an email to
<code>&lt;marsyas-developers@lists.sourceforge.net&gt;</code>.  A formal patch for
the texidoc is not required; we can take care of the technical
details.  Here is an example of a perfect documentation suggestion:

<pre class="verbatim">
To: marsyas-developers@lists.sourceforge.net
From: helpful-user@example.net
Subject: doc addition

In 4.2.1 Implicit patching vs. explicit patching, please add
----
It could be helpful to think of this like blah blah blah.
----
to the second paragraph.
</pre>

<h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Examples</h5>

<p>Small, easy-to-understand examples are also great.  If you have some
source code that illustrates something, we can add it to
<samp><span class="file">examples/</span></samp>.  You don't have to write any English at all!
