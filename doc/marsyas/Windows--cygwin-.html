<h3 class="section">Windows (cygwin)</h3>

   <p>Installation under Windows using the cygwin environment and gcc is
similar to Linux. One of the problems is that marsyas-0.2 uses
a newer version of the autoconf tools from the one provided in
cygwin. Therefore although the program can be compiled and installed
you will not be able to edit the Makefiles to add new files. Therefore
advanced developers are advised to use Linux for development or
get newer version of the autotools for cygwin.
