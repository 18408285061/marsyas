<p><a name="index-msl-17"></a>
One of the most useful and powerful characteristics of Marsyas
is the ability to create and combine MarSystems at run time. 
msl (marsyas scripting language) is a simple interpreter
that can be used to create dataflow networks, adjust controls,
and run sound through the network. It's used as a backend for
user interfaces therefore it has limited (or more accurately
non-existent) editing functionality. The current syntax
is being revised so currently it's more a proof-of-concept. 
Here is an example of creating a simple network in msl and
playing a sound file:

<pre class="example">     msl
     [ msl ] create Series playbacknet
     [ msl ] create SoundFileSource src
     [ msl ] create Gain g
     [ msl ] create AudioSink dest
     [ msl ] add src  &gt; playbacknet
     [ msl ] add g    &gt; playbacknet
     [ msl ] add dest &gt; playbacknet
     [ msl ] updctrl playbacknet SoundFileSource/src/string/filename technomusic.au
     [ msl ] run playbacknet
</pre>
   <p>The important thing to notice is that both the creation of MarSystems
and their assembly into networks can be done at run-time without
having to recompile any code. If anyone would like to pick
a project to do for Marsyas it would be to use the GNU readline
utility for it's commandline editing capabilities and try
to come up with some alternative syntax (I have some ideas
in that direction).
