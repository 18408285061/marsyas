<h4 class="subsection">3.2.2 <code>sfplay</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-sfplay-10"></a>
sfplay is a flexible command-line soundfile player that allows
playback of multiple soundfiles in various formats with either
real-time audio output or soundfile output. The following two example
show two extremes of using of sfplay: simple playback of foo.wav and
playing 3.2 seconds (-l) clips starting at 10.0 seconds (-s) into the
file and repeating the clips for 2.5 times (-r) writing the output to
output.wav (-f) at half volume (-g) playing each file in the
collection reggae.mf. The last command stores the MarSystem dataflow
network used in sfplay as a plugin in playback.mpl. The plugin is
essentially a textual description of the created network.  Because
MarSystems can be created at run-time the network can be loaded in a
sfplugin which is a generic executable that flows audio data through
any particular network.  Running sfplugin -p playback.mpl bar.wav will
play using the created plugin the file bar.wav. It is important to
note that although both sfplay and sfplugin have the same behavior in
this case they achieve it very different.  The main difference is that
in sfplay the network is created at compile time wheras in sfplugin
the network is created at run time.

<pre class="example">     sfplay foo.wav
     sfplay -s 10.0 -l 3.2 -r 2.5 -g 0.5 foo.wav bar.au -f output.wav
     sfplay -l 3.0 reggae.mf
     sfplay foo.wav -p playback.mpl
