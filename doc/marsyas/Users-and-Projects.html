<h2 class="chapter">7 Users and Projects</h2>

<p>One of the greatest feelings a researcher/programmer can have is
learning about people around the world doing exciting things with
her/his software. There have been many amazing projects done with
Marsyas and I hope to include them all in this section.  If you are
working on Marsyas and your name is not here, I would love to learn
about your project and include it in this section. Also send me an
email if you are one of the people mentioned in this section and you
have some more information about how marsyas was used in your project. 
I would also like to thank all of you who have found Marsyas
useful and helped me make it a better software framework.
