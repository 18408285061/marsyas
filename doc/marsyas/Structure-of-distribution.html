<h3 class="section">2.7 Structure of distribution</h3>

<p>Marsyas is primarily targeted to researchers and software
developers who want to build new systems and applications
using existing building blocks. Therefore familiarity
with the directory structure of the Marsyas distribution
is important for any serious work with the framework.

   <p>The main marsyas directory consists of the following
important files:

     <ul>
<li><b>INSTALL, COPYING, THANKS, README, AUTHORS, TODO:</b> text
files with important information. 
<li><b>ChangeLog:</b> the change log is not maintained as consistently
as it should be but it still provides useful information about the
evolution of the software. 
<li><b>configure.in, Makefile.am:</b> the main files edited by
the user/programmer that are required for the autotools. You will
only need to edit these if you are adding new subdirectories
or configuration options to the distribution. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">In addition there are the following subdirectories:

     <ul>
<li><b>marsyas:</b> the main directory containing all the
important source code of Marsyas. The source files in this
subdirectory are compiled into a static library that other
programs can use to access Marsyas functionality.

     <li><b>src:</b> this subdirectory contains several
sample executables that do various interesting things
using the Marsyas software framework. Some of them are intended
to be used as actual research tools others are more demonstration. 
All new Marsyas users should browse at least some of the source
code here.

     <!-- We use doxygen?  Really!?  check.  -gp -->
<li><b>doc:</b> contains both the user manual (which you are
currently reading) as well as the source code documentation
that is generated using doxygen. To regenerate the manual in pdf
or html type (in the doc subdirectory)
     <pre class="example">          &gt;make pdf
          &gt;make html
     </pre>
     <!-- @item @b{rawwaves:} contains some raw sound files that can be used -->
<!-- to test the sample executables in src/. -->
<li><b>qt4GUIs:</b> provides GUI interfaces using QT4. These will not
work with earlier versions of QT. You must have QT4 installed in order
to use or compile these applications. A README file is supplied with
each one that has instructions on how to compile and run it.

     <li><b>config:</b> configuration files used by autotools.

     <li><b>distributed:</b> Experimental Marsyas classes for
distributed processing.

     <li><b>marsyasMATLAB:</b> User MATLAB scripts (mfiles).

     <li><b>marsyasVisualStudio2003:</b>
Project and Solution files for Visual Studio 2003

     <li><b>marsyasVisualStudio2005:</b>
Project and Solution files for Visual Studio 2005

   </ul>
