<h3 class="section">4.1 Building the dataflow network</h3>

<p>The basic idea behind the design of Marsyas is that any audio
analysis/synthesis computation can be expressed as some type of
processing object, which we call MarSystem, that reads an input slice
of floating point numbers, performs some computation/transformation on
it, and writes it as another slice of floating point numbers. 
Networks of MarSystems can be combined and encapsulated as one
MarSystem. For example consider an audio processing series of
computations consisting of reading samples from a soundfile,
performing an short-time fourier transform (STFT) to calculate the
complex spectrum, performing an inverse STFT to convert back from the
frequency domain to time domain, then applying a gain to the amplitude
of the samples and writing the result to a soundfile.

   <p>As is very frequently the case with audio processing networks objects
the input of each stage is the output of the previous stage.  This way
of assembling MarSystems is called a Series composite.  Once a Series
Composite is formed it can basically be used as one MarSystem that
does the whole thing. A figure showing a block diagram-like
presentation of this network is shown in the figure bellow.

   <p>The main method that each MarSystem must support is <b>process</b> which
takes two arguments both arrays of floating point numbers used to
represent slices (matrices where one dimension is samples in time and
the other is observations which are interpreted as happening at the
same time). When the <b>process</b> method is called it reads data from
the input slice, performs some computation/transformation and writes
the results to the output slice. Both slices have to be preallocated
when process is called.  One of the main advantages of Marsyas is that
a lot of the necessary buffer allocation/reallocation and memory
management happens behind the scene without the programmer having to
do anything explicitly.

   <p>(NOTES TO MYSELF: talk about slices, distinction between samples and
observations)
