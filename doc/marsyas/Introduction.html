<p>MARSYAS (<b>M</b>usic <b>A</b>nalysis <b>R</b>etrieval and <b>S</b>ynthesis for
<b>A</b>udio <b>S</b>ignals) is a free software framework for audio
analysis, synthesis and retrieval written by George Tzanetakis. Please
direct any questions/comments about Marsyas to (gtzan@cs.uvic.ca). 
<a name="index-Tzanetakis_002c-George-1"></a>
The major underlying theme under the design of Marsyas has been to
provide an efficient and extensible framework for building audio
analysis (and synthesis) applications with specific emphasis on Music
Information Retrieval (MIR). A variety of building blocks for
performing common audio tasks are provided. Some representative
examples are: soundfile IO, audio IO, signal processing and machine
learning modules.  These blocks can be combined into data flow
networks that can be modified and controlled dynamically while they
process data in soft real-time.

   <p>Another goal has been to accomodate two different types of users:
naive and expert (of course in many cases the same person can operate
in both modes). Naive users are able to construct networks of
primitive objects and experiment with them through the use of
controls. They can interact with the system through the use of graphical
user interfaces or high level scripts without actually having to
compile any code. Marsyas provides a high-level of control at runtime
without sacrificing performance. Expert users can create new primitive
objects and create more complex applications by writing code and
compiling. These two modes of operation will become clearer in the
following sections of the manual. As with any piece of software the
holy grail is to provide maximum automatic support for the tasks that
can be automated while retaining expressiveness and the ability to
program complex systems for the particular domain of interest.

   <p>This framework has been created mainly to support George Tzanetakis's
research mainly in the emerging area of Music Information Retrieval
(MIR). Anyone who finds the framework useful is welcome to use it and
contribute to it. If you would like specific features to be developed
feel free to contact the author or support the project by donnating
money through the sourceforge page.
