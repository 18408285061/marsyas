<h3 class="section">2.6 Structure of distribution</h3>

<p>Marsyas is primarily targeted to researchers and software
developers who want to build new systems and applications
using existing building blocks. Therefore familiarity
with the directory structure of the Marsyas distribution
is important for any serious work with the framework.

   <p>The main marsyas directory consists of the following
important files:

<!-- TODO: update after fixing these files.  -gp -->
<ul>
<li><b>INSTALL, COPYING, THANKS, README, AUTHORS, TODO, Changelog:</b> text
files with important information in theory.  However, these have not
been updated in years.  We use <code>svn</code> log messages instead of the
Changelog. 
<li><b>configure.in, Makefile.am:</b> the main files edited by
the user/programmer that are required for the autotools. You will
only need to edit these if you are adding new subdirectories
or configuration options to the distribution. 
<li><b>marsyasConfig.pri:</b> edit this file to select your configure
options when using qmake. 
<li><b>marsyasAll.pro:</b> only developers should edit this file. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">In addition there are the following subdirectories:

     <ul>
<li><b>marsyas:</b> the main directory containing all the
important source code of Marsyas. The source files in this
subdirectory are compiled into a static library that other
programs can use to access Marsyas functionality.

     <li><b>bin:</b> executable files are compiled in <samp><span class="file">bin/release</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">bin/debug</span></samp>.

     <li><b>apps:</b> the source code for the above executables.

     <!-- We use doxygen?  Really!?  check.  -gp -->
<li><b>doc:</b> contains both the user manual (which you are
currently reading).  To regenerate the manual in pdf
or html type (in the doc subdirectory)
<!-- as well as the source code documentation -->
<!-- that is generated using doxygen. -->

     <pre class="example">          make pdf
          make html
     </pre>
     <li><b>apps/Qt4Apps:</b> provides GUI interfaces using QT4. These will not
work with earlier versions of QT. You must have QT4 installed in order
to use or compile these applications. A README file is supplied with
each one that has instructions on how to compile and run it.

     <li><b>config:</b> configuration files used by autotools.
