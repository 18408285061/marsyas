<h2 class="chapter">3 Tools</h2>

<p>The main goal of Marsyas is to provide an extensible framework that
can be used to quickly design and experiment with audio analysis and
synthesis applications.  The tools provided with the distribution,
although useful, are only representative examples of what can be
achieved using the provided components.  Marsyas is an extensible
framework for building applications, so the primary purpose of these
examples is to provide source code of working applications.

   <p>The executable files may be found in <samp><span class="file">bin/release/</span></samp>, while the
source code for those files is in <samp><span class="file">apps/{DIR}/</span></samp>.

<!-- fluff, not necessary.  -gp -->
<!-- It is important to realize that Marsyas is a -->
<!-- framework for building applications rather than a set of -->
<!-- applications. -->
<!-- They are also used as a -->
<!-- testbed to design/benchmark/experiment with the framework. -->
<!-- Marsyas is -->
<!-- meant to be an extensible framework so making the effort of -->
<!-- understanding the code behind the executables is necessary for any -->
<!-- serious work. These tools also show the capabilities of the framework -->
<!-- and also serve as pedagogical examples. -->
