1) Figure out the DirectX stuff in Windows for Visual Studio 9, nmake, mingw
2) Test Qt4 with the three windows configurations
3) Fix the broken default FindMatlab module (only works on Windows and Linux
and makes some wrong assumptions)
4) Convert the testing infrastructure to use CTest
5) Figure out CPACK for distribution packaging (maybe we really need
to start distributing binaries)
6) Add all the apps and Qt4Apps after weeding out dead code
7) Write detailed documentation for all configurations/operating systems
8) remove all the qmake/autotools stuff and perform general cleanup
9) Test on as many different systems with as many different compile
configurations as we can to make sure everything works
10) split the marsyas library into a set of smaller libraries
11) Clean-up redundant CMake code in different directories
12) Add the CMakeLists.txt files for the Ruby and possibly
Java, Lua bindings
