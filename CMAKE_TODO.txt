GENERAL
- Figure out CPACK for distribution packaging (maybe we really need
to start distributing binaries)

- Add all the apps and Qt4Apps after weeding out dead code

- Add the CMakeLists.txt files for the Ruby and possibly
Java, Lua bindings 

- fix the linking for the vamp plugins.  (sness is doing this)


OS-SPECIFIC
- Figure out the DirectX stuff in Windows for Visual Studio 9, nmake, mingw

- Fix the broken default FindMatlab module (only works on Windows and Linux
and makes some wrong assumptions)

// what does this mean?
- Test Qt4 with the three windows configurations


DOCS / USABILITY
- write developer docs for extending CMake


OTHER

- remove all the qmake/autotools stuff and perform general cleanup

- modify addMarSystem, etc. scripts to work with CMake instead
of autotools/qmake.

- Test on as many different systems with as many different compile
configurations as we can to make sure everything works

- split the marsyas library into a set of smaller libraries
